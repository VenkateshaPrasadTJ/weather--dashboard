# Weather Dashboard
This project is a Weather Dashboard built using React, TypeScript, and Material-UI (MUI). The application allows users to add and remove weather widgets that display the current weather for a specific location (New York), with temperature conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The dashboard's state is persisted across browser sessions using localStorage.

# Features
Add/Remove Weather Widgets: Users can add multiple weather widgets to the dashboard, each displaying weather information for a predefined location (e.g., New York).
Temperature Unit Toggle: Each widget allows toggling between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
State Persistence: Widgets added by users are persisted in the browser’s localStorage so that they remain even after a page refresh.
Responsive Design: The dashboard is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
Styled UI: The application uses Material-UI for a sleek design, and it incorporates a background image to enhance visual appeal.
# Technologies Used
React (with Hooks)
TypeScript
Material-UI (MUI)
React Icons
LocalStorage for state persistence
CSS Flexbox and Grid for layout and responsiveness

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
